Features:
* List of headings and the optional information about their level and if they break the hierarchycal structure
* List of sections with the header information, and includes the optional information about errors in the structure
* The headers are clickable so the document scrolls to the position of the element
* It detects changes in the DOM and when they finish, it updates its content (if needed)
